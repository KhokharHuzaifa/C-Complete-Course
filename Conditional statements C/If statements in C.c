#include<sh>
int main(){
    // Use "if" to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
    // Syntax :
    if (condition) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
    }
    // Examples:
    if (20 > 18) {
    printf("20 is greater than 18");
    }
    int x = 50;
    int y = 28;
    if (x > y) {
    printf("x is greater than y");
    }
    // Example explained :
    // In the example above we use two variables, x and y, to test whether x is greater than y 
    // (using the > operator). As x is 20, and y is 18, and we know that 20 is greater than 18, we print to the 
    // screen that "x is greater than y".
