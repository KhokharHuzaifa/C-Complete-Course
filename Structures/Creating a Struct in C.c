    // Create a Structure
// You can create a structure by using the struct keyword and declare each of its members inside curly braces:

struct MyStructure {   // Structure declaration
  int myNum;           // Member (int variable)
  char myLetter;       // Member (char variable)
}; // End the structure with a semicolon
